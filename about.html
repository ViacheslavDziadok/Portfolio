<p>Hello!</p>

<p>My name is Viacheslav Dziadok, I'm a Ukrainian IT specialist, 
    striving to become a professional in Switzerland</p>

<p>I finished National Aviation University in Kyiv, Ukraine, with the specialization 
    "<b>Software Engineering</b>" and obtained working qualifications, such as <b>Researcher</b> 
    (programming), <b>Computer Software Engineer</b>.</p>

<p>After the graduation from the university, 
    I was working as a freelance developer and IT service guy, 
    continuing to learn English and looking upon interesting things in IT world. 
    I found my interest in <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Data Science</b>.</p>

<p>For the past several years, I’ve completed several courses on <b>Coursera</b> 
    on the topics connected with <b>Deep Learning</b> by DeepLearning.ai (Computer Vision, NLP, GANs, TensorFlow/Torch etc.), 
    <b>Data Analytics</b> by Google, <b>Business Analysis</b> by IIBA and general programming skills, 
    like <b>Algorithms and Data Structures for Python</b> and <b>SQL for Data Science</b>.</p>

<p>I’m inclined to continue my self-education and post things that I find interesting.</p>
